  <p>"I want to live life with nothing but bliss!"<br><br> is arguably one of the lies that are hardest to decipher piece by piece to pinpoint exactly what the flaw in the argument is.<br><br>Dostoevsky made an incredible analysis in his book "Notes from the Underground": "Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick".<br><br>In ever-ending materialistic abundance, man would cling to self-sabotage.<br><br>So we should take the idea that life should be nothing but hedonistic pleasures and throw it in the garbage can.<br><br>Furthermore, when people say: "I want this pain and suffering to be gone!", they don't mean that. They meant: "I want to attach an adventurous experience to the inevitable agony so that my life could be worthwhile!" Well that is something interesting to think about. Because life by nature is in certain of great unjust and undeserved pain. We have all the reasons to rightfully be malevolent.<br><br>But how about we avoid taking the path of great evil? How about we reject hedonism and nihilism? We can voluntarily and forthrightly expose ourselves to great pain, and look for the Great Adventure in Life.<br><br>But how can that be done? How can such a mystery be uncovered? Where is God?<br><br>Well, you can look for truth and nothing but truth. The truth is youâ€”your emotions, your opinions, your intrinsic feelings, your perspective on the world. You can unleash them all out into the world, with great faith that the outcome will be the unfolding of many thrilling adventures and opportunities. Who cares if you might be wrong? Because oftentimes, you are. Speak your mind and act according to your will; then the world will grace your authenticity and bravery with new, exciting adventures.</p>
